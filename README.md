# Deep-Learning-Examples
Keras and Tensorflow

Deep Learning is capable of modeling complex problems that, in some cases, exceed human performance! With tremendous victories in the deep learning domain, a few great frameworks have emerged, intending to generalize deep learning processes from data pre-processing to model deployment. Though there are countable deep learning frameworks in practice, TensorFlow and PyTorch remain the preferred ones among practitioners and researchers over the years. As we know there are input layer, hidden layer(s) and output layer in a neuron adding more number of neurons or hidden layer through epoch has resulted in the decrease of loss in training set which is the objective of these examples.
